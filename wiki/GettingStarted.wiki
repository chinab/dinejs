=== Requirements ===

 * Make sure you have Java 5 or greater installed, if you don't have that, [http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp download it here].

 * grab the [http://dinejs.googlecode.com/files/dine-0.2-beta-all.jar latest release] from dine's project page 
 

=== Directory Structure ===
 
 * create 2 folders, one will contain the !JavaScript code dine will execute, all output will be written to the other folder

 * for this guide, let's assume your directory structure looks like this:

  /tmp/dine/

  /tmp/dine/dine-0.2-beta-all.jar

  /tmp/dine/js/

  /tmp/dine/output/

=== Executing dine ===

   * now go to _/tmp/dine_ and type _java -jar dine-0.2-beta-all.jar_ to see what parameters dine expects:

{{{
Usage: java -jar dinejs-all.jar <maxConcurrentThreads> <StepsBaseDirectory> <DownloadBaseDirectory> <seedStep>
}}}

 _maxConcurrentThreads_ is the maximum number of HTTP requests dine will execute concurrently

 _!StepsBaseDirectory _ is the directory containing the !JavaScript code dine will execute (_/tmp/dine/js_ in this example)

 _!DownloadBaseDir _ is the directory where the output is written to (_/tmp/dine/output_ in this example )

 _seedStep_ is the name of the first !JavaScript Step dine will execute


=== Write your first Step ===

Time to write our first Step! A Step is basically a piece of !JavaScript code that tells dine what content to fetch from the internet, which dine will do for you and then the Step can extract whatever information it wants.

Instead of the classical "Hello World", we'll write a step that echoes the page title of google.com
