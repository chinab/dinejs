== Installation ==

All you need to start using *dine* is Java 1.5 or higher, get it [http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp here] if you don't already have it installed.


Next grab the latest dine jar from [http://code.google.com/p/dinejs/downloads the downloads page].


== Write your first step ==


Let's have a look at a simple example:

You have to write a* step* now. A *step* fetches a website as XML and you can write code to parse it.

Create a file called _printTitle.js_ somewhere on your disk (let's assume you use _/home/me/dine_ as directory) and paste the following code in it:

{{{
createStep({
	getUrl: function() {
		return "http://www.google.com";
	},
	run: function() {		
			out.println( this.xmlObj..title );
	}
});
}}}

== Run the step ==

Open a shell, go to the directory where you downloaded the dine jar (let's assume you downloaded _dine-0.2-beta-all.jar_) and type the following:

{{{
java -jar dine-0.2-beta-all.jar -d home/me/dine -s printTitle
}}}

*dine* will now look for a file called _printTitle.js_ in the directory _home/me/dine_ and execute the *step* code in it. 

It should print _Google_ as a result because this is the page title of _http://google.com_
