=== Why do I have to write a *step* for each website I want to parse, couldn't I parse more than one in a *step*? === 

*dine* executes your *steps* _concurrently_ and the best way to parallelize execution is to start a single thread for each website to parse.

In fact a step is an implementation of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern command pattern].


=== Why should *steps* ONLY consist of methods and NEVER save information in instance variables? ===

*dine* compiles your steps only once at startup and uses a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern singleton] instance everytime a *step* is executed. That means that *steps* need to be _stateless_! 

This architecture allows a very low memory footprint of *dine*.

=== What XML parser is the javascript code using? ===

It uses _E4X _, check [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E4X wikipedia] and the [http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/E4X_tutorial in-depth tutorial from Mozilla] to learn more.


=== Why is there no XPath support? ===

I think that _E4X _ is much more intuitive and easier to use than _XPath_, so the *dine* API currently only offers support for _E4X _. Maybe there will also be an XPath API in the future, because a lot of people are familiar with it and it is much more powerful than _E4X _, yet harder to handle.
