=== What XML parser is the javascript code using? ===

It uses *E4X*, check [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E4X wikipedia] and the [http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/E4X_tutorial in-depth tutorial from Mozilla] to learn more.



=== Why do I have to write a *step* for each website I want to parse, couldn't I parse more than one in a *step*? === 

You probably could, but *dine* executes your *steps* _concurrently_ and the best way to parallelize execution is to start a single thread for each website to parse.
